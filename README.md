# portonmask

This repository is about my project Port'on Mask. You can find more information about it on my website dylandray.github.io.

The project is an amateur project, it works properly and with a 95% accuracy on my own laptop, in my room with unique parameters.
If you want to test it, you must change those parameters yourself. It's part of those hypothesis that I described on my pptx file.

In order to make it work properly, you should find online the shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat. I couldn't import it there since it's too heavy for github.
Have fun !
